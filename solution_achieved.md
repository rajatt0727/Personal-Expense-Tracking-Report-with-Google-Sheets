#### **Solutions Achieved:**
1. **Automated Categorization:** Expenses are categorized automatically based on a defined list, making it easy to track costs by category (e.g., Travel, Dining, Accommodation) using Google Sheets' VLOOKUP and array formulas.
   
2. **Dynamic Expense Analysis by Country:** A pivot table was used to calculate and display total expenses, average costs, and breakdowns by country and category, enabling users to quickly identify high-cost areas and adjust their spending.

3. **Advanced Filtering and Conditional Formatting:** Google Sheets' filter functions were applied to extract data based on specific criteria (e.g., travel to Spain), and conditional formatting highlighted high-expense countries (e.g., Spain, Colombia) for quick visibility.

4. **Interactive Dashboards and Visualizations:** Created pie charts and dynamic pivot tables to provide insights into the cost breakdown per category and country, enabling better financial planning and decision-making.

5. **Unique Value and Pattern Identification:** Identified unique months, countries, and cost breakdowns using advanced formulas (TEXTJOIN, UNIQUE, INDEX-MATCH) for enhanced data segmentation and reporting.

6. **Custom Logic for Budgeting:** Implemented IF formulas and conditional logic to label expenses greater than $100 as "Expensive" and others as "Cheap," streamlining the process of identifying high-cost expenditures.

7. **Monthly Breakdown & Comparison:** Visualized monthly expense distribution and provided percentage breakdowns to allow better month-to-month comparisons, ensuring optimized budget control.

8. **Google Sheets Integration:** Leveraged Google Sheets as the primary tool, ensuring seamless cloud-based accessibility, real-time updates, and collaboration features, enabling efficient personal financial management.
