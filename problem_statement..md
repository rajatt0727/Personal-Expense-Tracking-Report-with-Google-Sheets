#### **Problem Statement:**
Managing personal finances across multiple countries and categories presents several challenges, including tracking expenses, identifying high-cost areas, and understanding spending patterns. The need to analyze these expenses in a structured, automated manner is critical for budgeting and future financial planning.

In this project, we aim to solve the following key problems:
- Lack of a consolidated view of expenses across different countries, categories, and dates.
- Inability to easily filter, sort, and analyze personal spending habits across diverse regions.
- Manual expense categorization that takes time and may lead to inaccurate tracking of high-cost items.
- Absence of visual insights and percentage breakdowns of expenses by categories and countries, hindering effective financial decision-making.

The solution leverages Google Sheets' powerful features, including pivot tables, conditional formatting, filtering, and formulas, to automate and streamline personal expense management. This personal finance dashboard aims to provide a consolidated view of global expenses, enhancing data-driven decision-making.
